Welcome! Here is a 99 Bottles of Beer project I built on LearnStreet's Code Garage using ruby.
===============================================================================================================

Project description
-------------------------

“99 Bottles of Beer” is an American folk song, with rather lengthy and tedious lyrics. The song's simple lyrics are as follows:<br>
<br>
99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.<br>
Take 1 down, pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.<br>
<br>
98 bottles of beer on the wall, 98 bottles of beer.<br>
Take 1 down, pass it around, 97 bottles of beer on the wall.<br>
<br>
97 bottles of beer on the wall, 97 bottles of beer.<br>
Take 1 down, pass it around, 96 bottles of beer on the wall.<br>
<br>
…<br>
…<br>
<br>
2 bottles of beer on the wall, 2 bottles of beer.<br>
Take 1 down, pass it around, 1 bottle of beer on the wall.<br>
<br>
1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer.<br>
Take 1 down,  pass it around, no more bottles of beer on the wall.<br>
<br>
Not often do people sing the whole song, as it takes about 30 long boring minutes! But computers are good at repetitive tasks and we will make Ruby write out the lyrics to this song! In fact, this programming exercise is frequently coded in almost every language and you can find such examples on the internet.<br>
<br>
Back to our task, we have to write the function beerSong() which will return the lyrics of the song. Further, we will make beerSong() accept a starting number, like 99 or 34 or 1, from where the program starts execution.<br>
<br>

Try it out!
